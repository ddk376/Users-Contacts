rails generate controller creates helper files: views, helper method inheritance, etc.

helper methods go in ApplicationController - available to all controllers

prefer 'addressable' tool to writing manual URLs.
Because in the absence of an explicit render statement, your controller will by default try to render a template with the same name as the controller action - in this case, it was looking for a template called index.html.erb in app/views/users.

The key method here is #params. #params is a method provided by ActionController::Base that returns a hash of all the parameters available. The parameters are sourced from three places:

Route parameters (e.g. the :id from /users/:id)
Query string (the part of the URL after the ?: ?key=value)
POST/PATCH request data (the body of the HTTP request).


'params' method is part of ApplicationController, likely


!!!!always need renders in controller actions!!!


change_column(:users, :username, :string, :null => false, :unique => true)
^ right way to alter table?

Can enforce unique on DB level without index?? Cannot -- must have index for uniqueness

#destroy, #update, etc. -- raises error if called on Class and IDs dont' exists. Prefer 404 error to errors thrown by these verbs. #find first (throws 404 if not found), then destroy/update the instance of the Model -- will return false if invalid.


Calling resources method twice on same table/controller creates twice as many routes -- use once, with options hash, and block, ie...

resources :users, only: [:create, :destroy, :index, :show, :update] do
  resources :contacts, only: [:index]
end
